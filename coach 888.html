    <div class="coach-bio">
        Coach Quinonez-Robinson is a <em>former D1 athlete</em> with over <em>14 years of experience</em> in the sport of track and field. Her journey began with just <em>one person who believed in her</em>—and that belief became the fire that shaped her destiny.

        She pours that same energy into every athlete she trains. She loves working with those who are willing to <em>work hard</em>, <em>dig deep</em>, and most importantly—<em>be better</em>.

        For Coach Q, track is more than a sport—it’s a mirror of life. It takes <em>time</em>, <em>faith</em>, and <em>patience</em> to reach greatness. Setbacks happen. Doubt creeps in. But she teaches her athletes that through it all, <em>God has a plan</em>.

        <em>“God told me to have faith and be patient. There is always a rainbow after every storm.”</em>

        Her coaching is built on love, belief, and purpose—and that’s exactly what makes the New York Phoenix rise.
