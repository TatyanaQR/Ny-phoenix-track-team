    <h2>About the Coach</h2>
    <p>Coach Quinonez-Robinson is a former Division I athlete who has been running track for over 14 years. Her passion for the sport is rooted in her love for people and her unshakable faith.</p>
    <p>She believes that track and field is a <span class="highlight">*mirror of life*</span> — it takes time, discipline, and perseverance to overcome trials and tribulations. But once those storms pass, there is <span class="highlight">*always a rainbow on the other side*</span>. Through coaching, she teaches her athletes that greatness isn’t given — <span class="highlight-orange">*it’s earned through grit, grace, and God*</span>.</p>
    <p>Her journey began when just one person believed in her, and now she has made it her mission to be that person for others. With <span class="highlight">*patience, purpose, and power*</span> in her words, Coach Quinonez-Robinson walks in faith and lights the way for the next generation.</p>
    <div class="bio-quote">“God is amazing. He’s the reason I can chase my dreams while guiding others to achieve theirs.”</div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Coaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight-orange">“I coach with purpose, patience, and passion.</span> To me, track and field is more than a sport — it’s a reflection of life itself. Every hurdle, every sprint, every finish line mirrors the struggles and triumphs we face in the real world. I believe in training the body, strengthening the mind, and feeding the soul.”</p>
    <p>“My athletes don’t just run for times — they run with intention. I teach them that greatness is not handed out, it’s earned through <span class="highlight-orange">discipline, faith, and unwavering belief in self.</span> I will always be the coach who sees the potential others overlook, and I will push, protect, and pray for every young soul that steps onto my track. Because for me, coaching isn’t a job — <span class="highlight">it’s a calling.</span>”</p>
