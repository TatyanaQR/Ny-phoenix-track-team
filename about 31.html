    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p><em>God is amazing</em> and has allowed me to chase my dreams while guiding others to become successful.</p>
    <p>I started running track because all it took was <em>one person to believe in me</em> â€” that belief carried me through trials and tribulations, and now I give that same belief to others.</p>
    <p>Coach Quinonez-Robinson is a former D1 athlete with 14 years of experience. She loves the sport and thrives working with people determined to grow. Her <em>patience</em> and <em>diligence</em> set her apart from other coaches.</p>
