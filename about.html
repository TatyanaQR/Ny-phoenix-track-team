      <h1>Meet Coach Quinonez-Robinson</h1>
      <p class="about-text">
        <strong>Coach Quinonez-Robinson</strong> is a <em>former Division 1 athlete</em> who has been running track for over <em>14 years</em>.
        Her passion for the sport is rooted in her love for people and her unshakable faith. She believes in working with anyone
        who has the determination to become better. Her patience and diligence are what set her apart from other coaches.
        <br><br>
        Track and field, in her eyes, is a reflection of life — it requires time, commitment, and endurance. Through the
        challenges, one discovers their true strength. And just like life, <em>there’s a rainbow after every storm</em>. 🌈
        <br><br>
        Coach Q’s journey began with just one person believing in her — now she carries that same light and belief for every
        athlete she coaches. Her purpose is deeper than the stopwatch — it’s about building faith, character, and legacy.
        <br><br>
        <em>“God is amazing.”</em> He gave her this purpose, and every step she takes with her team is a testament to His grace.
