    <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px; text-align: left; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.8;">
      <p><em>"I didn’t get here by luck—I got here by faith, fight, and favor."</em></p>

      <p>I wasn’t handed this journey. I had to earn it, pray through it, and rise through every setback.
      Track didn’t just shape my life—it revealed my purpose.</p>

      <p>I started running because someone believed in me. That belief planted a seed—and that seed grew into a fire.
      A fire that carried me through every challenge, every doubt, and every finish line.</p>

      <p>Track and field is more than competition—<em>it’s a reflection of life</em>.
      You fall. You struggle. But with enough heart, <em>you rise</em>.</p>

      <p>There were times I questioned the path. But God always reminded me—<em>“Be still. I am preparing you.”</em></p>

      <p>He didn’t just call me to coach. He called me to lead, to mentor, to awaken something greater in others.</p>

      <p><strong>My mission is simple:</strong> to guide athletes toward purpose, strength, and the power of belief.</p>

      <p>I’m a former Division I athlete who’s been running track since 2009.
      I graduated college in 2022, began coaching in 2023, and by 2025—God gave me the vision to build something of my own.</p>

      <p><em>Hard work beats talent when talent refuses to work hard.</em><br>
      And I’ll believe in every athlete I coach… just like someone once believed in me.</p>
