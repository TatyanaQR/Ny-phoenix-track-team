                <p>Coach Quinonez-Robinson is a former Division I athlete who has been running track for over 14 years. Her passion for the sport is rooted in her love for people and her unshakable faith.</p>
                <p>She believes that track and field is a <span class="highlight">*mirror of life*</span> — it takes time, discipline, and perseverance to overcome trials and tribulations. But once those storms pass, there is <span class="highlight">*always a rainbow on the other side*</span>. Through coaching, she teaches her athletes that greatness isn’t given — <span class="highlight-orange">*it’s earned through grit, grace, and God*</span>.</p>
                <p>Her journey began when just one person believed in her, and now she has made it her mission to be that person for others. With <span class="highlight">*patience, purpose, and power*</span> in her words, Coach Quinonez-Robinson walks in faith and lights the way for the next generation.</p>
