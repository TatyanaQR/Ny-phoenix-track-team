    <h1 class="page-title">Coaching Philosophy</h1>

    <div class="philosophy-content">
        At New York Phoenix, we coach with <em>intention</em>, <em>love</em>, and unshakable <em>faith</em>. We believe that every athlete is born with potential—but it takes <em>discipline</em>, <em>belief</em>, and <em>resilience</em> to unlock it.

        To us, track and field is more than a sport—it’s a reflection of life. You’ll face hurdles. You’ll fall. You’ll want to quit. But that’s where growth lives. We teach our athletes to turn pain into power and fear into fuel.

        We don’t chase trophies. We build *character*. We chase purpose. And we run with a fire that the world can’t dim.

        Our training is intense—but our care runs deeper. We remind our athletes every day that their identity isn’t tied to a stopwatch. <em>It’s tied to their effort, their heart, and their faith.</em>

        <em>“Greatness is earned when no one is watching.”</em> That’s why we rise. That’s why we run. That’s why we’re Phoenix.
